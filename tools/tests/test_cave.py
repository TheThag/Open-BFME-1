"""Structural tests for the code cave; stdlib + pytest + capstone.

Every assertion here corresponds to a bug that actually shipped into a build
and was only caught by disassembling the result. All three were invisible in
the source and silent at build time:

  * the new section's Characteristics were packed at +0x28 instead of +0x24,
    so the cave came out neither readable nor executable;
  * a blob built for one address and placed at another: the assembler of the
    day padded a section whose org was unaligned, and the trampoline landed
    three bytes short of the payload's first instruction. Every relative
    operand a blob carries has the same failure;
  * the payload's exit ran off the end of its own code and fell through into
    the helper functions emitted after it, because the relocated prologue is
    appended after the WHOLE blob, helpers included.

They are asserted against the real retail image rather than a synthetic PE:
the alignment bug in particular only appears at a cave offset that is not a
multiple of four, which is a property of real allocation, not of a fixture.
